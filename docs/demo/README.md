# Demo Artifacts

- `entity-brief-demo.html` is a sample report generated by the add-on.
- `screenshot-report.png` captures the report overview.
- `screenshot-top-entities.png` and `screenshot-entity-index.png` capture key sections.

Notes:
- The current demo report uses public docs `26301227`, `25943454`, `25943453`, `25943452`.
- Generate a fresh demo via `python scripts/generate_demo_report.py <doc_id> --output docs/demo/entity-brief-demo.html`.
- Charts render only when the HTML is opened in a browser (JS required).
- The demo report includes static image fallbacks if JS is blocked.
- The demo report includes filters and export buttons (client-side).
- The demo report includes duplicate suggestions, tag writeback summary, and support letter UI.
- The demo report shows the documents included in the run.
- Optional helper: `python scripts/render_demo_images.py` writes `docs/demo/top-entities.svg` and `docs/demo/entity-index.txt` for screenshot prep (ignored by git).
