title: "Entity Brief"
description: >
  <p><strong>Entity Brief</strong> builds a cross-document index of extracted entities (people, orgs, locations, dates)
  and produces a single HTML report with simple visuals (D3) for investigative/FOIA workflows.</p>
  <p><em>Privacy:</em> This version does not send document text, entity strings, or usage metrics outside DocumentCloud/GitHub Actions.</p>
instructions: >
  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> For best results, run DocumentCloud's entity extraction first (if your documents do not have entities yet).</p>
